## So, what would my dream job be? 
 ## At the moment, I would like to work alongside top innovators and policy makers in order to optimize outcomes of the future.
  ## What does that mean? 
   ## I would like to contribute to risk mitigation and economic empowerment in both the short and long run, with a minimally biased viewpoint.

### How can I ensure that my viewpoints are minimally biased? I lead by example with respect to:
  ### I believe in a minimalistic philosophy. Right now, all of my physical possessions can fit inside of my 2022 CrossTrek Subaru (Stella). Probably all of it can fit inside of the back hatch, even. I do not care much about a large salary, and I wanted a minimal sized home (quiet is important for me, though).
 
### What would my day to day work consist of?
  ### I would enjoy teaching research methods to future students, as well as bringing out independent thought in top leaders. I would also enjoy doing research and publishing my thoughts locally, similarly to a platform as here, but perhaps in a more organized manor. 

### How would I be paid?
  ### I could imagine a scenario where an institution(s) better managed and supported some of my idea generation, and we worked more closely together to improve communication speeds. A reasonable fraction of the profits would be returned, as that is fair. I imagine that I would donate a vast majority to wherever I or my future spouse felt like. I think that this would perhaps avoid me having to pay taxes on my income, too. As I would be free to choose where to allocate it, and I would donate well above the tax bracket.
