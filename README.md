## So, what would my dream job be? 

 ## At the moment, I would like to work on BNB chain and grow the chain from the bottom and maintain balance. Also, to enhance and support artists to grow the chain.
  ## Also, I would like a lifelong role working under CZ. I imagine Binance is very flexible and I would like to support the company. I am actively applying for a job there. Binance can be very lean and low cost by doing exactly what they are doing, and I want to be apart of their team.
  
  
  ## What does that mean? 
   ## I would like to contribute to risk mitigation and economic empowerment in both the short and long run, with a minimally biased viewpoint.


### How can I ensure that my viewpoints are minimally biased? I lead by example with respect to:

  ### I believe in a minimalistic philosophy. Right now, all of my physical possessions can fit inside of my 2022 CrossTrek Subaru (Stella). Probably all of it can fit inside of the back hatch, even. I do not care much about a large salary, and I wanted a minimal sized home (quiet is important for me, though). This will indicate that I do not have an attachment to material possessions, and have more freedom with my mind. I can imagine scenarios where I admit being wrong, without worrying about personal repercussions. I will probably hold a decent amount of crypto. But, I plan on growing from the bottom. I will invest in new start ups (correlated with altruistic causes iteratively).
 
### What would my day to day work consist of?

  ### I would enjoy spending a lot of time with my significant other, and growing with others in my surrounding. I would also enjoy doing research and publishing my thoughts locally, similarly to a platform as here, but perhaps in a more organized manor. I would very much enjoy following top innovators and bouncing ideas with them, and pushing their work - to speed it up and enhance it. I believe top research requires neuroplasticity, which is ideal for me, as I like to learn and apply on the fly - without relying on memory. I also like to push people. Sometimes I push a little too hard and regret it later. However, I always try to improve myself.


### How would I be paid?

  ### I would be paid for supporting those that I invest in. I would try and invest from the bottom up, so there wouldn't be much need for taxes.
  ### I would like to be paid via BNB packages (I would join with financial advisors to maximimize the estimated best packages on a monthly basis for variability).
  ### Also, these donations would not be limited to just the US.
  
  
### What about the staple programs that require heavy amounts of financial investment? I.E. Social Security, Defense, Medicare and Medicaid

 ### That could a part of the policy work, to apply algorithms to minimize the budget deficit. Also, I would be willing to allocate my fair share to social security (while weaning off it in the long run, I do not see myself accepting social security). Also, defense and security could likely be shrank to 5% in perhaps 10 years or less. Improvements in healthcare efficiency could likely shrink Medicare to 10%, and then the rest could be fun donations (optimize the benefits of altruism). Interest on the debt would then be eradicated, very soon. 


### What about your feelings, are you interested in someone?

  ### Yes, I am. However, there are logistically problems that need worked out, and I am extremely shy -- plus it is hard for me to open up. I would like for my job to have remote, so I can have flexibility to travel wherever. I would still enjoy meeting with the team on an "x" occassion.
