## So, what would my dream job be? 
 ## At the moment, I would like to work alongside top innovators and policy makers in order to optimize outcomes of the future.
  ## What does that mean? 
   ## I would like to contribute to risk mitigation and economic empowerment in both the short and long run, with a minimally biased viewpoint.

### How can I ensure that my viewpoints are minimally biased? I lead by example with respect to:
  ### I believe in a minimalistic philosophy. Right now, all of my physical possessions can fit inside of my 2022 CrossTrek Subaru (Stella). Probably all of it can fit inside of the back hatch, even. I do not care much about a large salary, and I wanted a minimal sized home (quiet is important for me, though). This will indicate that I do not have an attachment to material possessions, and have more freedom with my mind. I can imagine scenarios where I admit being wrong, without worrying about personal repercussions.
 
### What would my day to day work consist of?
  ### I would enjoy teaching research methods to future students, as well as bringing out independent thought in top leaders. I would also enjoy doing research and publishing my thoughts locally, similarly to a platform as here, but perhaps in a more organized manor. I would very much enjoy following top innovators and bouncing ideas with them, and pushing their work - to speed it up and enhance it. I believe top research requires neuroplasticity, which is ideal for me, as I like to learn and apply on the fly - without relying on memory.

### How would I be paid?
  ### I could imagine a scenario where an institution(s) better managed and supported some of my idea generation, and we worked more closely together to improve communication speeds. A reasonable fraction of the profits would be returned, as that is fair. I imagine that I would donate a vast majority to wherever my future spouse and I both felt like. The person I have in mind would probably kick me to the curb if not, anyways. I think that this would perhaps avoid me having to pay taxes on my income, too. As I would be free to choose where to allocate it, and I would donate well above the tax bracket.
  ### Also, these donations would not be limited to just the US.
  
### What about the staple programs that require heavy amounts of financial investment? I.E. Social Security, Defense, Medicare and Medicaid
 ### That could a part of the policy work, to apply algorithms to minimize the budget deficit. Also, I would be willing to allocate my fair share to social security (while weaning off it in the long run, I do not see myself accepting social security). Also, defense and security could likely be shrank to 5% in perhaps 10 years or less. Improvements in healthcare efficiency could likely shrink Medicare to 10%, and then the rest could be fun donations (optimize the benefits of altruism). Interest on the debt would then be eradicated, very soon. 
 
 ### Then, I would like to allocate my energy in multiple forms to doing what I enjoy doing, work alongside top innovators and policy makers in order to optimize outcomes of the future.
 
 ### So what classes would you like to lead?
  ### The best would be a blend of three classes. All three capstone projects with students in their final year, at two different universities. The problem would be tackling grandest challenges going on in the world. One would be with top policy leaders. The other with top engineers. The third would be the integration of the two classes, where the solutions (theoretical and concretely solved), would...
   ### Students would then have the options of: joining a top level position in the company that implements solution, creating their own company, or pursuing their research in academia. The class either passes or fails collectively. They answer the solutions as they arise, or they do not. Students would leave the class at different times, depending on who wants to take charge of the solutions.
   
   
   ### Why not industry?
    ### I would not feel right earning an income disproportionate to professors that have inspired me. Also, I would be the hardest/ most productive worker in any given field, so it would be confusing why my salary would be so low. It would just not make any sense. On the other hand, I would feel guilty being in a probably non-diverse group, with people not acknowleding the suffering people are going through in other parts of the world.
