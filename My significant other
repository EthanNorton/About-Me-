To the person I trust most.

I hope you are able to look past my impulsive behavior, sometimes I just get so into things, I lack perspective. 
I will probably confuse you with my absent-mindedness, and you should be worried about my ability to complete simple tasks.
I have twitches in my behavior, and I have never felt at ease in public. Most people glance at me and think the opposite (or used to), but I feel like you would have seen through that.
I am working on my stability, but I also believe that you will help keep me balanced.
I need somebody that will always be there for me as deep down I feel like a child still. I believe that the inner child is within all, and I trust you with the most sensitive parts of me.

How I see you:

You are truly caring. You want to help me and always be there for me, while seeing through me completely. 
You acknowledge my weaknesses, and only want to support me and help me work through my insecurities.
You were there for me and greeted me with warmth in a most challenging moment of my life. I have no doubt that you would do the same again, if the opportunity presented itself.
You complete me. I feel most like myself when I imagine us together.
You have a beautiful aroma, and you aroused me in a way that nobody else has. I see yourself as having superior emotional strength relative to me.

I promise that I will be transparent with you, bring out the best in you, and support you through whatever happens. I desire to understand you at the deepest level.
I hope we can meet soon, and that I will not be awkward.
